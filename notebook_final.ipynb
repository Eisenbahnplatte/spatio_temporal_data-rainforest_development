    "ten years of the data cube as well. As a tool to develope our model, we created three modules to process the data.\n",
    "To visualize that change, we have to modify the data cube in such a way that it is possible with the Laptops that we have. A test cube was first created as a subset of the original cube. Firstly to decrease the size and secondly to only look at the amazon region instead of the whole cube. Eventually we selected following extent as our research area: XXXX\n",

    "The way the methodology to create the data was designed, not all changed between different LCCS categories are sometimes detected, putting the results into a different perspective.\n",
    "It is also worth nothing, that abrupt changes are better captured than gradual ones. Since the deforestation is a relatively drastic event into the landscape, one should think that it will definitely show in the data. The base of the maps that created the data cube is a 300m spatial resolution, which was calculated off 1km pixels, meaning any changes under 1km will not be displayed.\n",
    "Also changes occurring in the 2014 - 2015 period are reduced to forest changes only. It is not further specified if that includes only loss of forest or gain of forest as well.\n",
    "In the category that we used for the detection of rainforest (tree_broadleaved_evergreen_closed_to_open), if the amount of broadleaved, evergreen forest in that pixel is between 16 and 100%, it will be classified into that category. It is therefore possible that in an \"tree_broadleaved_evergreen_closed_to_open\" pixel, only 20% are actually broadleaved evergreen trees. Gaps were filled with nearest-neighbour method that has its own positive and negative aspects.\n",
    "The total tree fraction of a pixel that has >0% trees in it is always assigned to a single tree type. In our class used, it means that the >15% broadleaf, evergreen trees will get the broad-leaved evergreen tree type. 90% in that class group are actually broadleaved-evergreen trees while 10% are natural grasses.\n",
